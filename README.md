# In this project, the aim is to predict stocks from the DAX index using a neural network. The neural network employed is an LSTM (long short-term memory) network. Following the generation of predictions, a mean-variance portfolio optimization is conducted. The mean-variance portfolio is further enhanced by integrating two additional parameters in a subsequent model iteration. Additionally, certain models are actively managed, while others remain unmanaged for a period of one year. To evaluate these models, they are pitted against the DAX index and compared with models that do not employ AI for stock value prediction; instead, these models rely on statistical calculations.
